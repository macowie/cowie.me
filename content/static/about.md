I'm Matthew Cowie, a software developer from Chicago. I work primarily
in Ruby and/or Rails, Javascript, Sass/CSS, and Java. Check my [now page](/now) for what I'm currently into.

When I'm not writing code, reading code, or reading about writing code I enjoy
video games, biking, hiking, chess, and baseball.

The function of this blog is to <s>force</s>get me to reflect on, and share, my
experiences and ideas, chiefly those on my work in development.
Check the [colophon](/colophon) for details on the execution.
